FIXME: This list is incomplete.

Table problems
--------------

- ROWSPAN/COLSPAN does not (always) work.

* Form problems
---------------

- Resizing messes up forms, and then scrolling behaves erratically.

- Entries and buttons are not responsive to mouse clicks.

* Misc problems
---------------

- The API needs some loving.  (FIXME: come up with a list of things
  that are ugly/broken/etc.)

- We might want to speed up redraw on expose.

- If a page renders with a link under the cursor, the link cannot be
  clicked unless you move the cursor off the link and then back on

- Remaining Memory leaks:
   * new_context in gdk_pixbuf - loader need to be fixed to know when
     to stop, send animation_done and free context
   * sometimes there are some lost TextSlaves
   * leak in test_cb - don't worry about it, it is only debugging stuff
   * any more? sure :-)

- We store images in ImageFactory by name and not by complete URL, so when
  you have equaly named images on different sites, we don't load new ones
  and happily using old "incorrect" ones (try freshmeat.net and
  then helixcode.com and you will see what I am talking about)

- `html_object_draw_background()' can be very slow sometimes.  This
  makes selection very very slow.  Look at http://www.breakupgirl.com/
  for an example.

* Editor bugs
-------------

- Setting the paragraph style in a region is kind of broken in many
  cases.

- Pasting misbehaves in some cases.

- The amount of scrolling performed by PageUp/PageDown is not correct.
