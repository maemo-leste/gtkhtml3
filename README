What is GtkHTML?
----------------

GtkHTML is a lightweight HTML rendering/printing/editing engine.  It
was originally based on KHTMLW, part of the KDE project, but is now
being developed independently.

Mailing list
------------

There is a GtkHTML mailing list. It is intended to be used by GtkHTML
hackers and developers using GtkHTML library. If you think you have
found bug, please report it there.

You could subscribe to this list on:

	http://lists.ximian.com/mailman/listinfo/gtkhtml

You could report bug by sending bug report to:

	gtkhtml@ximian.com

Please don't send subscription requests to the list. Use above
mentioned URL or send it to gtkhtml-request@ximian.com.

Requirements
------------

In order to compile GtkHTML, you need libgnome[ui] 1.112.1 (or later),
Bonobo 1.112.1 (or later), gnome-print 2.2.0 (or later) and GAL 2.1.0 (or
later).

Optionally you may want to install GConf 1.0.7 (or later).

If you want to try the test program `testgtkhtml', you also need
glibwww 0.2 or later.  GLibWWW is available from:

    ftp://www.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/unstable/sources/glibwww/

To try it out, run testgtkhtml in the source directory, i.e:

    cd src
    ./testgtkhtml

WARNING: testgtkhtml's URL fetching code is very buggy.
